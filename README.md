# Project Betoniera - Frontend
## Description
Frontend [React](https://react.dev) application for the unofficial JobsAcademy calendar manager.

## Get started with development
To start developing, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
After that, you can clone the repository, then install the dependencies with the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
Before starting the development server, you need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project, with the following content:
```bash
VITE_API_URL = http://localhost:4000
```
Note:
- You can also make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
- The `VITE_API_URL` variable is the url of the backend server, which is not included in this repository.

Then, you can start the development server with:
```bash
npm start
```
